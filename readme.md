What is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based, human-readable data interchange format used to exchange data between web clients and web servers. The format defines a set of structuring rules for the representation of structured data.


JSON was originally based on the JavaScript programming language and was introduced as the page 

scripting language for the Netscape Navigator web browser. JSON is also sometimes used in desktop 

and server-side programming environments
